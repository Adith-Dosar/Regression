# Air Quality Index (AQI) Prediction

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict the Air Quality Index (AQI) using machine learning models based on various environmental factors such as pollutant concentrations, weather conditions, and geographic data. By accurately predicting AQI, individuals and organizations can take proactive measures to mitigate health risks and improve air quality management strategies.

## Objectives
1. **Accurate Prediction**: Develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts AQI levels.
2. **Feature Analysis**: Identify and analyze the key features that significantly impact air quality.
3. **User-Friendly Interface**: Create an intuitive interface for users to input their data and receive predictions.
4. **Health and Environmental Insights**: Provide insights into air quality trends and potential health risks.

## Key Features
1. **Pollutant Concentrations**: Levels of pollutants such as PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, CO, and O3.
2. **Weather Conditions**: Temperature, humidity, wind speed, and other meteorological factors.
3. **Geographic Data**: Location, altitude, and other geographic information.
4. **Temporal Data**: Time of day, day of the week, and seasonal variations.
5. **Historical Data**: Previous AQI data to train the model and improve prediction accuracy.

## Data Collection
The dataset includes the following columns:
- **Date**: The date and time of the AQI measurement.
- **Location**: The geographic location where the AQI was measured.
- **PM2.5**: Concentration of PM2.5 particles (in µg/m³).
- **PM10**: Concentration of PM10 particles (in µg/m³).
- **NO2**: Concentration of nitrogen dioxide (in µg/m³).
- **SO2**: Concentration of sulfur dioxide (in µg/m³).
- **CO**: Concentration of carbon monoxide (in µg/m³).
- **O3**: Concentration of ozone (in µg/m³).
- **Temperature**: Ambient temperature (in °C).
- **Humidity**: Relative humidity (in %).
- **Wind Speed**: Wind speed (in m/s).
- **AQI**: The Air Quality Index value.

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the collected data, handling missing values, outliers, and normalizing the data.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Create new features that might improve the model's performance, such as wind direction or pollutant ratios.
3. **Model Selection**: Experiment with different machine learning models, such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Neural Networks, to find the best-performing model.
4. **Model Training**: Train the selected model using the preprocessed data.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.
6. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimize the model's hyperparameters to improve its performance.
7. **Deployment**: Deploy the model as a web application or API for users to access and use.

## Expected Outcomes
1. **Accurate Predictions**: The model should provide accurate predictions of AQI levels, helping individuals and organizations plan and mitigate health risks.
2. **Insights into Air Quality**: Users will gain insights into which factors contribute most to air quality.
3. **Health and Environmental Management**: Provide recommendations for improving air quality and managing environmental health risks.
4. **User Empowerment**: Users will feel more empowered to take proactive measures based on predicted AQI levels.

## Future Work
1. **Expand Feature Set**: Incorporate additional features such as satellite imagery, real-time sensor data, and traffic data.
2. **Improve Model Accuracy**: Continuously improve the model's accuracy by incorporating more data and refining the model.
3. **User Feedback**: Collect user feedback to improve the model and the user interface.
4. **Integration with Environmental Tools**: Integrate the model with environmental monitoring tools and platforms for real-time predictions and alerts.
